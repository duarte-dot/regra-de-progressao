# Progress Rule Project

A Java program with an intuitive terminal interface that allows you to:

- Register evaluative activities for the period, whether they are exercises or projects. This way, you'll have complete control over your tasks and goals.

- Input scores for the registered exercises and projects for the period. The program will automatically calculate the percentage achieved, revealing your performance clearly and objectively.

- Based on the percentage achieved, you will find out if you passed or failed. The magic happens when you exceed the 85% threshold. It's your ticket to the next period, an achievement worth celebrating!
